# Linetime

Linetime is a tool for adding timestamps to an untimed GPX file, as downloaded from Caltopo or Alltrails. It can make it much easier to bulk geotag photos if you have a rough knowledge of where you were and add some keytimes. Times at intermediate points between keytimes are interpolated.
